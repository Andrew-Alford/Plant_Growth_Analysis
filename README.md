# Plant Growth Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of the PlantGrowth data set in R. It focuses on understanding the impact of different plant food diets on plant growth.

## Contents
- Analysis of three groups: a control and two experimental treatments.
- Statistical measures including minimum, quartile, median, mean, and maximum weights of plants.
- Visual representations like histograms and boxplots for group comparison.
- T-tests for comparing the means of the control group with each treatment group.

## Findings
- The control group showed consistent growth patterns, providing a baseline for comparison.
- Treatment groups exhibited varying responses, indicating the differential impact of plant food diets.
- Significant differences in mean weights were observed between the control and treatment groups.
- Data variability and outliers were carefully analyzed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of plant growth patterns.

## Conclusions
The analysis concludes that different plant food diets have a significant impact on plant growth. While some treatments showed a positive effect on growth, others did not differ significantly from the control. This study highlights the importance of choosing the right plant food for optimal growth and demonstrates the utility of statistical analysis in understanding plant growth dynamics. It serves as a valuable resource for plant scientists and enthusiasts in optimizing plant care.

## Structure
The document is structured to explain each analysis step clearly, making it accessible to a general audience.

## Purpose
This analysis is useful for researchers and students in plant science, offering a practical example of statistical analysis in R.
